Counter picker for Dota 2, with info on hero abilities and photo hero detection.

True Sight provides full information for counter picking enemy heroes, and the details of their abilities. As well as typing the name of enemy heroes, you can also take a photo of the enemy team -- ideal when picking!

Counter picks can be filtered by role: Carry, Mid, Support, Off lane, Roaming, or Jungler. Drop me an email if you'd like an extra role added or you feel the role filters aren't quite right.

Also features hero abilities mode for newer players: see a list of all the enemy heroes' abilities, with key spells like  stuns, silences, and ultimates listed first. Useful just for seeing a quick list of the stuns the enemies have, or for finding out important details, such as damage type.
